Additional tests carried out on [GT Metrix](https://gtmetrix.com/) (Website Performance Testing and Monitoring Online Tool). GT Metrix scanned all website pages during tests carried out from London based server. Although GT Metrix uses Lighthouse, the test results achieved were much better - please see the reports attached:

- [Desktop results](./docs/gtmetrix-report-desktop.pdf)
