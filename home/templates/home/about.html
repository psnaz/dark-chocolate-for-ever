                      <h3>Yesss, we're all about our mission:</h3>
                      <br>
                      <h4 class="logo-font font-weight-bold">1. Junk Food can transform into Super Food.</h4>
                      <br>
                      <p>We strongly believe that chocolate can be just as nourishing as it is indulgent. So we are encouraging 
                      you to up the cacao in your diet and add extra nutrient rich ingredients to the mix when possible.</p>
                      <br>
                      <h4 class="logo-font font-weight-bold">2. Chocolate doesn’t have to be just a cheap commodity, it is a precious ingredient!</h4>
                      <br>
                      <p>It’s time for high quality cacao to take the limelight! It’s usually a bit more expensive, 
                          but the cost of your health, wellbeing and the environment is much less! Besides, all the 
                          farming communities around the world get more out of this! So it’s a WIN-WIN!
                      </p>
                      <br>
                      <h4 class="logo-font font-weight-bold">3. Together we can do it! We can move away from sugary generic flavours to the real taste of cacao!</h4>
                      <br>
                      <p>Many of our suppliers reduced or scrapped all together the refined sugar, dairy and palm fat, and 
                          put high quality cocoa nibs centre stage, you you get the true taste of real cacao in every bite. 
                          That’s if you’re ready for it. We all know well that old habits die hard…
                      </p>
                      <br>
                      <h4 class="logo-font font-weight-bold text-blue">That’s why our mission at the Dark Chocolate for Ever is to change the way the world sees chocolate!</h4>
                      <br>
                      <p>It all started in 2018, when our founders, John and Petra, discovered in Guatemala, while on their 
                          family gap year trip around the world, that the original chocolate ingredient - the humble cacao bean - 
                          is a little gem of a superfood with huge health benefits and a centuries’ old tradition. 
                          Dismayed that chocolatehad lost its way worldwide, John and Petra vowed to champion good chocolate 
                          and put cacao back on the top. They teamed up with dark chocolatiers in the UK and Europe 
                          to bring you an extensive choice of dark chocolate indulgence!
                      </p>
                      <br>
                      <p>Wishing you many brighter days,</p>
                      <p>With love for dark chocolate,</p>
                      <br>
                      <p>Happy Shopping!</p>
